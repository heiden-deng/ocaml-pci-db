# This is a test file that is structurally the same as the PCI IDs file that
# ships with most *nix OSs.
#
# It will contain as much of a mixture of allowed syntax as possbile including
# comments and different use of whitespace (where approriate) and will contain
# a minimal set of test devices and classes for the ocaml-pci-db parser to play
# with.
#
#	List of PCI ID's
#
# Vendors, devices and subsystems. Please keep sorted.

# Syntax:
# vendor  vendor_name                       <-- no tab, two spaces
#	device  device_name                     <-- one tab, two spaces
#		subvendor subdevice  subsystem_name <-- two tabs, one space, two spaces

# Increasingly complex trees with no whitespace in names
0001  SimpleVendorName1
# Simple vendor name with simple device
0002  SimpleVendorName2
	0001  SimpleDeviceName-2-1
0003  SimpleVendorName3

# Using whitespace in last field
0005  VendorName with whitespace
	000a  DeviceName with whitespace and hex ID
# Using double whitespace in the last field

# Ending in whitespace
		000d 000e  SubDeviceName ending in a space
# Including tabs in name

# Using punctuation
0006  VendorName with punctuation :;<=>?@[\]^_`{|}~`/

# This the standard illegal name

# Syntax:
